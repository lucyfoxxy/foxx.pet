1. Warm the oat milk until steamy (not boiling) and whisk with stardust sugar.
2. Fold in flour with a wooden spoon while humming a launch countdown; the dough listens better that way.
3. Roll, sprinkle with cinnamon, and spiral into a greased pan.
4. Bake until golden, then brush with a glaze of powdered sugar, citrus zest, and just a hint of plum extract.
5. Share immediately; any leftovers tend to vanish into wormholes.
