## Launchpad Mornings

The launchpad smelled faintly of cinnamon toast because I forgot to wipe the crumbs from my tool bag. I traced every rivet on
the homemade rocket twice, pencil behind my ear and tail twitching in tempo with the calibrations. A dozen test fires later
the thrusters were still sputtering, but the stars were patient with me.

## Ignition

I whispered a promise to the moon, flipped the last switch, and the rocket hummed with a glow brighter than the morning sun.
Neighbors waved from the street as my capsule rose, the whole town looking like a pocket-sized model I could place on my desk.

> "Remember to send postcards," someone yelled, so I broadcast sketches of the view down to the planet in real time.

## Orbit Reflections

The orbit only lasted ninety minutes, but that was enough time to chart three new constellations and fall in love with the
silence between them. I drifted home with a journal full of starlight and a promise to build a bigger rocket tomorrow.
