## The Miners
The miners chipped a hollow into asteroid 448-P, hung string lights from cables, and invited me over the comms for tea. It turns
out loose-leaf jasmine floats like tiny comets before sinking back into the pot. We anchored ourselves with silk ribbons tied to
bolts in the bulkhead and talked about home for hours.

Someone produced a harmonica, and the little cave filled with bluesy echoes. Every time the kettle sang, we tightened the
ribbons, clinked cups against our helmets, and toasted to new friends.
