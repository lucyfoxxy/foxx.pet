## You Gonna Need

a lot of stuff

## Preparations

Gather a cast-iron cauldron and set it over a gentle flame. Sweat onions with garlic until translucent, then tumble in diced
meteor potatoes, rainbow carrots, and chunks of charred tofu. Cover with vegetable stock, a splash of soy, and a whisper of
liquid smoke. Let the stew murmur for forty minutes while you toast comet crackers on the side.

Right before serving, stir through a swirl of miso and top with chopped herbs. The broth should taste like a campfire picnic on
a cool moonlit ridge.
